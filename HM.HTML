<h3> Lectures: </h3>
<ul>
<li> Lecture Series by Prof. S. Thangavelu: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01087"> "Bargmann and Fock meet Hardy: An uncertainty principle for
operators." </a> </li> 
</ul>
<ul>
In these lectures, we discuss certain bounded linear
operators on Fock/twisted Fock spaces leading to the definition of
twisted Heisenberg groups $ H^n_\lambda(\C)$. We construct a certain
unitary representation of this group and use an operator analogue of
Hardy's theorem proves that this representation is irreducible.

<h3> Seminar/Colloquium:</h3>
<ul> 
<li> Spectra of negatively curved Riemannian manifolds: Dr. Mayukh Mukherjee, IIT Bombay, 18-04-2024   </li>
</ul>
<ul>
We discuss various issues surrounding the spectra of complete Riemannian manifolds (and sometimes orbifolds) of non-positive curvature. These include, among other topics, absolute and (absence of) singularly continuous spectra, small eigenvalues and eigenfunction decay. This describes previous (and ongoing) joint work with Ballmann and Polymerakis. 
</ul>

<ul>

<li> Convergence to equilibrium in degenerate systems: Dr. Saumyajit Das, IIT Bombay, 11-04-2024   </li>

</ul>

<ul>
 In this talk, we will address the large-time behaviour of solutions to a reaction-diffusion system involving degeneracies in diffusion. The nonlinearity of the system comes from mass action kinetics.

We demonstrate that there is the so-called “Indirect diffusion effect”. More specifically, we show an effective diffusion for the non-diffusive species incurred by a combination of diffusion from diffusive species and reversible reaction between the species. We employ the celebrated entropy method to derive explicit convergence rates. 
</ul>

<li> Randomness, Rational Points, and Oscillatory Integral: Dr. Niclas Technau, Max Planck Institute, Bonn, 22-03-2024   </li>

</ul>

<ul>
Our world contains highly complex phenomena: one gram of water contains more than 10^22 molecules.
Analysing the motion of water by attempting to compute the motion of each molecule is
a fallacious endeavour. A powerful and versatile tool to describe complex systems is probability theory
predicting that irregularities and difficulties on small scales cancel out beautifully on larger scales.

We shall use this line of thought to predict how many rational points are located near a compact manifold.
After a basic introduction, we shall discuss the role of oscillatory integrals and curvature for proving such predictions.
The talk is based on joint work with Rajula Srivastava where we studied classes of hypersurfaces,
putting the prediction power of randomness to the test.

<li> Counting Rational Points near Manifolds: Dr. Rajula Srivastava, University of Bonn, 21-03-2024   </li>


</ul>


<ul>
How many rational points with a denominator of a given size lie within a certain distance from a compact, "non-degenerate" manifold? This talk is about recent progress towards answering this question, based on joint work with Damaris Schindler and Niclas Technau. We shall discuss a new way of examining the problem: under a combined lens of harmonic analysis (oscillatory integrals) and homogeneous dynamics (quantitative non-divergence estimates). We shall also talk about applications to problems concerning the Hausdorff dimension and measure refinements for the set of well-approximable points on non-degenerate manifolds.
